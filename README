This is the server for the 2d jump and run game engine nodachi2D. It should be possible to make this into any kind of 2d
game you can think of (side scrolling platformer, space game, eagles eye game, isometric) with minor modifications to the
initialisation of box2d.

It is neccessary to get Box2D and SFML(for the network code) and install/setup those according to the following instructions:
SFML and Box2D are both licensed under the libpng license and not my own work.

posix:
Put it anywhere you like and create a link to the folder containing the following files/folders:

drwxr-xr-x 5 4096  3. Okt 12:54 .
drwxr-xr-x 9 4096  3. Okt 12:54 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1  191 28. Feb 2010  Box2DConfig.cmake
-rw-r--r-- 1 2249  3. Apr 2010  Box2D.h
-rw-r--r-- 1 5033 29. MÃ¤r 2010  CMakeLists.txt
drwxr-xr-x 3 4096  3. Okt 12:54 Collision
drwxr-xr-x 2 4096  3. Okt 12:54 Common
drwxr-xr-x 4 4096  3. Okt 22:23 Dynamics

The link goes to include/Box2D, like so:
include/Box2D -> /home/kamisori/work/Box2D_v2.1.2/Box2D/Box2D/

This way you can very simply switch to a new version of box2d if there should come any.
Or if you plan to modify box2d you can switch between your version and the original one more easily.

windows:
probably it is best to put the folder Box2D containing the following files and folders directly into the include folder:

folders:
Collision
Common
Dynamics

files:
Box2DConfig.cmake
Box2D.h
CMakeLists.txt


                                        SFML
                                        ----

posix:
you need to build it from source, and use --prefix=/usr i think. at least i had some problems when i set it up months ago.
If i remember correctly, the libsfml-*.so must go into /usr/lib, while building from source puts it into /usr/local/lib.

windows:
no idea. get the binaries, and put it into the project root folder and into the bin/debug and bin/release folders. probably.
